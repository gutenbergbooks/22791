PREFACE.</a></h4>

<hr class = "micro">

<p><span class = "smallcaps">In</span> the selection of my last
Shakespearean revival at the Princess’s Theatre, I&nbsp;have been
actuated by a desire to present some of the finest poetry of our great
dramatic master, interwoven with a subject illustrating a most memorable
era in English history. No play appears to be better adapted for this
two-fold purpose than that which treats of Shakespeare’s favorite hero,
and England’s favorite king&mdash;Henry the Fifth.</p>

<p>The period thus recalled is flattering to our national pride; and
however much the general feeling of the present day may be opposed to
the evils of war, there are few amongst us who can be reminded of the
military renown achieved by our ancestors on the fields of Crecy,
Poitiers, and Agincourt, without a glow of patriotic enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The political motives which induced the invasion of France in the
year 1415 must be sought for in the warlike spirit of the times, and in
the martial character of the English sovereign. It is sufficient for
dramatic purposes that a few thousands of our countrymen, in their march
through a foreign land, enfeebled by sickness and encompassed by foes,
were able to subdue and scatter to the winds the multitudinous hosts of
France, on whose blood-stained soil ten thousand of her bravest sons lay
slain, mingled with scarcely one hundred Englishmen!<a class = "tag"
name = "tag1a" id = "tag1a" href = "#note1a">*</a> Such a marvellous
disparity might well draw forth the pious acknowledgment of King
Henry,&mdash;</p>

<div class = "poem">
<p>“O God, thy arm was here;&mdash;</p>
<p>And not to us, but to thy arm alone,</p>
<p>Ascribe we all.&mdash;When, without stratagem,</p>
<p>But in plain shock and even play of battle,</p>
<p>Was ever known so great and little loss</p>
<p>On one part and on the other?&mdash;Take it, God,</p>
<p>For it is only thine!”</p>
</div>

<p>Shakespeare in this, as in other of his dramatic histories, has
closely followed Holinshed; but the light of his genius irradiates the
dry pages of the chronicler. The play of Henry the Fifth is not only a
poetical record of the past, but it is, as it were, “a song of triumph,”
a lay of the minstrel pouring forth
<span class = "pagenum">vi</span>
a <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘pœan’">pæan</ins> of
victory. The gallant feats of our forefathers are brought vividly before
our eyes, inspiring sentiments not to be excited by the mere perusal of
books, reminding us of the prowess of Englishmen in earlier days, and
conveying an assurance of what they will ever be in the hour of
peril.</p>

<p>The descriptive poetry assigned to the “Chorus” between the acts is
retained as a peculiar feature, connecting and explaining the action as
it proceeds. This singular personage, so different from the Chorus of
antiquity, I&nbsp;have endeavoured to render instrumental to the general
effect of the play; the whole being planned with a view to realise, as
far as the appliances of a theatre can be exercised, the events of the
extraordinary campaign so decisively closed by the great conflict of
Agincourt, which ultimately placed two crowns on the brow of the
conqueror, and resulted in his marriage with Katharine, the daughter of
Charles the Sixth, King of France. Shakespeare does not in this
instance, as in <i>Pericles</i> and the <i>Winter’s Tale</i>, assign a
distinct individuality to the Chorus. For the figure of Time, under the
semblance of an aged man, which has been heretofore presented, will now
be substituted Clio, the muse of History. Thus, without violating
consistency, an opportunity is afforded to Mrs. Charles Kean, which the
play does not otherwise supply, of participating in this, the concluding
revival of her husband’s management.</p>

<p>Between the fourth and fifth acts I have ventured to introduce, as in
the case of <i>Richard the Second</i>, a&nbsp;historical episode of
action, exhibiting the reception of King Henry on returning to his
capital, after the French expedition.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to include the manifold incidents of the royal
progress in one scene: neither could all the sites on which they
actually took place be successively exhibited. The most prominent are,
therefore, selected, and thrown into one locality&mdash;the approach to
old London bridge. Our audiences have previously witnessed the
procession of Bolingbroke, followed in silence by his deposed and
captive predecessor. An endeavor will now be made to exhibit the heroic
son of that very Bolingbroke, in his own hour of more lawful triumph,
returning to the same city; while thousands gazed upon him with mingled
devotion and delight, many of whom, perhaps, participated in the earlier
reception of his father, sixteen years before, under such different and
painful circumstances. The Victor of Agincourt is hailed, not as a
successful usurper, but as a conqueror; the adored sovereign of his
people; the pride
<span class = "pagenum">vii</span>
of the nation; and apparently the chosen instrument of heaven, crowned
with imperishable glory. The portrait of this great man is drawn
throughout the play with the pencil of a master-hand. The pleasantry of
the prince occasionally peeps through the dignified reserve of the
monarch, as instanced in his conversations with Fluellen, and in the
exchange of gloves with the soldier Williams. His bearing is invariably
gallant, chivalrous, and truly devout; surmounting every obstacle by his
indomitable courage; and ever in the true feeling of a christian
warrior, placing his trust in the one Supreme Power, the only Giver of
victory! The introductions made throughout the play are presented less
with a view to spectacular effect, than from a desire to render the
stage a medium of historical knowledge, as well as an illustration of
dramatic poetry. <i>Accuracy</i>, not <i>show</i>, has been my object;
and where the two coalesce, it is because the one is inseparable from
the other. The entire scene of the episode has been modelled upon the
facts related by the late Sir Harris Nicholas, in his translated copy of
a highly interesting Latin MS., accidentally discovered in the British
Museum, written by a Priest, who accompanied the English army; and
giving a detailed account of every incident, from the embarkation at
Southampton to the return to London. The author tells us himself, that
he was present at Agincourt, and “<i>sat on horseback with the other
priests, among the baggage, in the rear of the battle</i>.” We have,
therefore, the evidence of an eyewitness; and by that testimony I have
regulated the general representation of this noble play, but more
especially the introductory episode.</p>

<p>The music, under the direction of Mr. Isaacson, has been, in part,
selected from such ancient airs as remain to us of, or anterior to, the
date of Henry the Fifth, and, in part, composed to accord with the same
period. The “Song on the Victory of Agincourt,” published at the end of
Sir Harris Nicholas’s interesting narrative, and introduced in the
admirable work entitled “Popular Music of the Olden Time,” by
W.&nbsp;Chappell, F.S.A., is sung by the boy choristers in the Episode.
The “Chanson Roland,” to be found in the above-named work, is also given
by the entire chorus in the same scene. The Hymn of Thanksgiving, at the
end of the fourth act, is supposed to be as old as <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span> 1310. To give effect to the music, fifty
singers have been engaged.</p>

<p>As the term of my management is now drawing to a close, I may,
perhaps, be permitted, in a few words, to express
<span class = "pagenum">viii</span>
my thanks for the support and encouragement I have received. While
endeavouring, to the best of my ability and judgment, to uphold the
interests of the drama in its most exalted form, I&nbsp;may
conscientiously assert, that I have been animated by no selfish or
commercial spirit. An enthusiast in the art to which my life has been
devoted, I&nbsp;have always entertained a deeply-rooted conviction that
the plan I have pursued for many seasons, might, in due time, under
fostering care, render the Stage productive of much benefit to society
at large. Impressed with a belief that the genius of Shakespeare soars
above all rivalry, that he is the most marvellous writer the world has
ever known, and that his works contain stores of wisdom, intellectual
and moral, I&nbsp;cannot but hope that one who has toiled for so many
years, in admiring sincerity, to spread abroad amongst the multitude
these invaluable gems, may, at least, be considered as an honest
labourer, adding his mite to the great cause of civilisation and
educational progress.</p>

<p>After nine years of unremitting exertion as actor and director, the
constant strain of mind and body warns me to retreat from a combined
duty which I find beyond my strength, and in the exercise of which,
neither zeal, nor devotion, nor consequent success, can continue to
beguile me into a belief that the end will compensate for the many
attendant troubles and anxieties. It would have been impossible, on my
part, to gratify my enthusiastic wishes, in the illustration of
Shakespeare, had not my previous career as an actor placed me in a
position of comparative independence with regard to speculative
disappointment. Wonderful as have been the yearly receipts, yet the vast
sums expended&mdash;sums, I&nbsp;have every reason to believe, not to be
paralleled in any theatre of the same capability throughout the
world&mdash;make it advisable that I should now retire from the
self-imposed responsibility of management, involving such a perilous
outlay; and the more especially, as a building so restricted in size as

<p><i>Boy.</i> As young as I am, I have observed these three swashers.
I&nbsp;am boy to them all three: but all they three, though they would
serve me, could not be a man to me; for, indeed, three such anticks do
not amount to a man. For Bardolph,&mdash;he is white-livered and
red-faced; by the means whereof ’a faces it out, but fights not. For
Pistol,&mdash;he hath a killing tongue and a quiet sword; by the means
whereof ’a breaks words, and keeps whole weapons. For Nym,&mdash;he hath
heard that men of few words are the best men; and therefore he scorns to
say his prayers, lest ’a should be thought a coward: but his few bad
words are match’d with as few good deeds; for ’a never broke any man’s
head but his own, and that was against a post when he was drunk. They
will steal any thing, and call it&mdash;purchase. They would have me as
familiar with men’s pockets as their gloves or their handkerchiefs:
which makes much against my manhood, if I should take from another’s
pocket to put into mine; for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs.
I&nbsp;must leave them, and seek some better service: their villainy
goes against my weak stomach, and therefore I must cast it up.</p>

<p>Holinshed states that when the people of Rouen petitioned Henry V.,
the king replied “that the goddess of battle, called Bellona, had three
handmaidens, ever of necessity attending upon her, as blood, fire, and
famine.” These are probably the <i>dogs of war</i> mentioned in Julius
Cæsar.</p>

throne,</i>] King Henry V. was born at Monmouth, August 9th, 1388, from
which place he took his surname. He was the eldest son of Henry
Bolingbroke, Earl of Derby, afterwards Duke of Hereford, who was
banished by King Richard the Second, and, after that monarch’s
deposition, was made king of England, <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span> 1399. At eleven years of age Henry V. was a
student at Queen’s College, Oxford, under the tuition of his half-uncle,
Henry Beaufort, Chancellor of that university. Richard II. took the
young Henry with him in his expedition to Ireland, and caused him to be
imprisoned in the castle of Trym, but, when his father, the Duke of
Hereford, deposed the king and obtained the crown, he was created Prince
of Wales and Duke of Cornwall.</p>

<p>In 1403 the Prince was engaged at the battle of Shrewsbury, where the
famous Hotspur was slain, and there wounded in the face by an arrow.
History states that Prince Henry became the companion of rioters and
disorderly persons, and indulged in a course of life quite unworthy of
his high station. There is a tradition that, under the influence of
wine, he assisted his associates in robbing passengers on the highway.
His being confined in prison for striking the Chief Justice, Sir William
Gascoigne, is well known.</p>

<p>These excesses gave great uneasiness and annoyance to the king, his
father, who dismissed the Prince from the office of President of his
Privy Council, and appointed in his stead his second son, Thomas, Duke
of Clarence. Henry was crowned King of England on the 9th April, 1413.
We read in Stowe&mdash; “After his coronation King Henry called unto him
all those young lords and gentlemen
<span class = "pagenum">21</span>
who were the followers of his young acts, to every one of whom he gave
rich gifts, and then commanded that as many as would change their
manners, as he intended to do, should abide with him at court; and to
all that would persevere in their former like conversation, he gave
express commandment, upon pain of their heads, never after that day to
come in his presence.”</p>

<p>This heroic king fought and won the celebrated battle of Agincourt,
on the 25th October, 1415; married the Princess Katherine, daughter of
Charles VI. of France and Isabella of Bavaria, his queen, in the year
1420; and died at Vincennes, near Paris, in the midst of his military
glory, August 31st, 1422, in the thirty-fourth year of his age, and the
tenth of his reign, leaving an infant son, who succeeded to the throne
under the title of Henry&nbsp;VI.</p>

<p>The famous Whittington was for the third time Lord Mayor of London in
this reign, <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> 1419. Thomas Chaucer,
son of the great poet, was speaker of the House of Commons, which
granted the supplies to the king for his invasion of France.</p>

<p>(<a class = "hist" name = "noteI_C" id = "noteI_C" href =
"#tagI_C">C</a>) <i>Bedford,</i>] John, Duke of Bedford, was the third
son of King Henry IV., and his brother, Henry V., left to him the
Regency of France. He died in the year 1435. This duke was accounted one
of the best generals of the royal race of Plantaganet.</p>

<p>King Lewis XI. being counselled by certain envious persons to deface
his tomb, used these, indeed, princely words:&mdash; <i>“What honor
shall it be to us, or you, to break this monument, and to pull out of
the ground the bones of him, whom, in his life time, neither my father
nor your progenitors, with all their puissance, were once able to make
fly a foot backward? Who by his strength, policy, and wit, kept them all
out of the principal dominions of France, and out of this noble Dutchy
of Normandy? Wherefore I say first, God save his soul, and let his body
now lie in rest, which, when he was alive, would have disquieted the
proudest of us all; and for his tomb, I&nbsp;assure you, it is not so
worthy or convenient as his honor and acts have deserved.” &mdash;Vide
Sandford’s History of the Kings of England.</i></p>

<p>(<a class = "hist" name = "noteI_D" id = "noteI_D" href =
"#tagI_D">D</a>) <i>Gloster,</i>] Humphrey, Duke of Gloster, was the
fourth son of King Henry IV., and on the death of his brother, Henry V.,
became Regent of England. It is generally supposed he was strangled. His
death took place in the year 1446.</p>

<p>(<a class = "hist" name = "noteI_E" id = "noteI_E" href =
"#tagI_E">E</a>) <i>Exeter,</i>] Shakespeare is a little too early in
giving Thomas Beaufort the title of Duke of Exeter; for when Harfleur
was taken, and he was appointed governor of the town, he was only Earl
of Dorset. He was not made Duke of Exeter till the year after the battle
of Agincourt, November 14, 1416. Exeter was half brother to King Henry
IV., being one of the sons of John of Gaunt, by Catherine Swynford.</p>

<p>(<a class = "hist" name = "noteI_F" id = "noteI_F" href =
"#tagI_F">F</a>) <i>Archbishop of Canterbury,</i>] The Archbishop’s
speech in this scene, explaining King Henry’s title to the crown of
France, is closely copied from Holinshed’s chronicle, page 545.</p>

<p>“About the middle of the year 1414, Henry V., influenced by the
persuasions of Chichely, Archbishop of Canterbury, by the
<span class = "pagenum">22</span>
dying injunction of his royal father, not to allow the kingdom to remain
long at peace, or more probably by those feelings of ambition, which
were no less natural to his age and character, than consonant with the
manners of the time in which he lived, resolved to assert that claim to
the crown of France which his great grandfather, King Edward the Third,
had urged with such confidence and success.” &mdash;<i>Nicolas’s History
of the Battle of Agincourt.</i></p>

Salique,</i>] According to this law no woman was permitted to govern or
be a Queen in her own right. The title only was allowed to the wife of
the monarch. This law was imported from Germany by the warlike
Franks.</p>

<p>(<a class = "hist" name = "noteI_H" id = "noteI_H" href =
"#tagI_H">H</a>) <i>Tennis-balls, my liege.</i>] Some contemporary
historians affirm that the Dauphin sent Henry the contemptuous present,
which has been imputed to him, intimating that such implements of play
were better adapted to his dissolute character than the instruments of
war, while others are silent on the subject. The circumstance of Henry’s
offering to meet his enemy in single combat, affords some support to the
statement that he was influenced by those personal feelings of revenge
to which the Dauphin’s conduct would undoubtedly have given birth.</p>

<p>Have for the guilt of France (O, guilt, indeed!)</p>
<p>Confirm’d conspiracy with fearful France.</p>
</div>

<p>About the end of July, Henry’s ambitious designs received a momentary
check from the discovery of a treasonable conspiracy against his person
and government, by Richard, Earl of Cambridge, brother of the Duke of
York; Henry, Lord Scroop of Masham, the Lord Treasurer; and Sir Thomas
Grey, of Heton, knight. The king’s command for the investigation of the
affair, was dated on the 21st of that month, and a writ was issued to
the Sheriff of Southampton, to assemble a jury for their trial; and
which on Friday, the 2nd of August, found that on the 20th of July,
Richard, Earl of Cambridge, and Thomas Grey, of Heton, in the County of
Northumberland, knight, had falsely and traitorously conspired to
collect a body of armed men, to conduct Edmund, Earl of March,<a class =
"tag" name = "tag3a" id = "tag3a" href = "#note3a">*</a> to the
frontiers of Wales, and to proclaim him the rightful heir to the crown,
in case Richard II. was actually dead; but they had solicited Thomas
Frumpyngton, who personated King Richard, Henry Percy, and many others
from Scotland to invade the realm, that they had intended to destroy the
King, the Duke of Clarence, the Duke of Bedford, the Duke of Gloucester,
with other lords and great men; and that Henry, Lord Scroop, of Masham,
consented to the said treasonable purposes, and concealed the knowledge
of them from the king. On the same day the accused were reported by Sir
John Popham, Constable of the Castle of Southampton, to whose custody
they had been committed, to have confessed the justice of the charges
brought against them, and that they threw themselves on the king’s
mercy; but Scroop endeavoured to
<span class = "pagenum">35</span>
extenuate his conduct, by asserting that his intentions were innocent,
and that he appeared only to acquiesce in their designs to be enabled to
defeat them. The Earl and Lord Scroop having claimed the privilege of
being tried by the peers, were remanded to prison, but sentence of death
in the usual manner was pronounced against Grey, and he was immediately
executed; though, in consequence of Henry having dispensed with his
being drawn and hung, he was allowed to walk from the Watergate to the
Northgate of the town of Southampton, where he was beheaded.
A&nbsp;commission was soon afterwards issued, addressed to the Duke of
Clarence, for the trial of the Earl of Cambridge and Lord Scroop: this
court unanimously declared the prisoners guilty, and sentence of death
having been denounced against them, they paid the forfeit of their lives
on Monday, the 5th of August. In consideration of the earl being of the
blood royal, he was merely beheaded; but to mark the perfidy and
ingratitude of Scroop, who had enjoyed the king’s utmost confidence and
friendship, and had even shared his bed, he commanded that he should be
drawn to the place of execution, and that his head should be affixed on
one of the gates of the city of York. &mdash;<i>Nicolas’s History of the

"#tagII_A">A</a>) <span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span><i>the man
that was his bedfellow,</i>] So, Holinshed: “The said Lord Scroop was in
such favour with the king, that he admitted him sometimes to be his
<i>bedfellow</i>.” The familiar appellation, of <i>bedfellow</i>, which
appears strange to us, was common among the ancient nobility. There is a
letter from the sixth Earl of Northumberland (still preserved in the
collection of the present duke), addressed “To his beloved cousin,
Thomas Arundel,” &amp;c., which begins “<i>Bedfellow</i>, after my most
hasté recommendation.” &mdash;<i>Steevens</i>.</p>

<p>This unseemly custom continued common till the middle of the last
century, if not later. Cromwell obtained much of his intelligence,
during the civil wars, from the mean men with whom he slept.
&mdash;<i>Malone</i>.</p>

<p>After the battle of Dreux, 1562, the Prince of Condé slept in the
same bed with the Duke of Guise; an anecdote frequently
<span class = "pagenum">36</span>
cited, to show the magnanimity of the latter, who slept soundly, though
so near his greatest enemy, then his prisoner. &mdash;<i>Nares.</i></p>

<p>(<a class = "hist" name = "noteII_B" id = "noteII_B" href =
"#tagII_B">B</a>) <i>For me,&mdash;the gold of France did not
seduce;</i>] Holinshed observes, “that Richard, Earl of Cambridge, did
not conspire with the Lord Scroop and Thomas Grey, for the murdering of
King Henry to please the French king, but only to the intent to exalt to
the crown his brother-in-law Edmund, Earl of March, as heir to Lionel,
Duke of Clarence; after the death of which Earl of March, for divers
secret impediments not able to have issue, the Earl of Cambridge was
sure that the crown should come to him by his wife, and to his children
of her begotten; and therefore (as was thought), he rather confessed
himself for need of money to be corrupted by the French king, than he
would declare his inward mind, &amp;c., which if it were espied, he saw
plainly that the Earl of March should have tasted of the same cup that
he had drunk, and what should have come to his own children he merely
doubted, &amp;c.”</p>

<p>A million of gold is stated to have been given by France to the
conspirators.</p>

<p>Historians have, however, generally expressed their utter inability
to explain upon what grounds the conspirators built their expectation of
success; and unless they had been promised powerful assistance from
France, the design seems to have been one of the most absurd and
hopeless upon record. The confession of the Earl of Cambridge, and his
supplication for mercy in his own hand writing, is in the British
Museum.</p>

<p>(<a class = "hist" name = "noteII_C" id = "noteII_C" href =
"#tagII_C">C</a>) <i>Touching our person, seek we no revenge;</i>] This
speech is taken from Holinshed:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Revenge herein touching my person, though I seek not; yet for the
safeguard of my dear friends, and for due preservation of all sorts,
I&nbsp;am by office to cause example to be showed: Get ye hence,
therefore, you poor miserable wretches, to the receiving of your just
reward, wherein God’s majesty give you grace of his mercy, and
repentance of your heinous offences.”</p>

<p>(<a class = "hist" name = "noteII_D" id = "noteII_D" href =
"#tagII_D">D</a>) <i>Cheerly to sea; the signs of war advance:</i>] “The
king went from his castle of Porchester in a small vessel to the sea,
and embarking on board his ship, called The Trinity, between the ports
of Southampton and Portsmouth, he immediately ordered that the sail
should be set, to signify his readiness to depart.” “There were about
fifteen hundred vessels, including about a hundred which were left
behind. After having passed the Isle of Wight, swans were seen swimming
in the midst of the fleet, which, in the opinion of all, were said to be
happy auspices of the undertaking. On the next day, the king entered the
mouth of the Seine, and cast anchor before a place called Kidecaus,
about three miles from Harfleur, where he proposed landing.”
&mdash;<i>Nicolas’s History of Agincourt</i>.</p>

<p>The departure of Henry’s army on this occasion, and the separation
between those who composed it and their relatives and

friends, is thus described by Drayton, who was born in 1563, and died in

Well Beloved, was King of France during the most disastrous period of
its history. He ascended the throne in 1380, when only thirteen years of
age. In 1385 he married Isabella of Bavaria, who was equally remarkable
for her beauty and her depravity. The unfortunate king was subject to
fits of insanity, which lasted for several months at a time. On the 21st
October, 1422, seven years after the battle of Agincourt, Charles VI.
ended his unhappy life at the age of 55, having reigned 42 years. Lewis
the Dauphin was the eldest son of Charles VI. He was born 22nd January,
1396, and died before his father, December 18th, 1415, in his twentieth
year. History says, “Shortly after the battle of Agincourt, either for
melancholy that he had for the loss, or by some sudden disease, Lewis,
<ins class = "correction" title = "spelling unchanged">Dovphin</ins> of
Viennois, heir apparent to the French king, departed this life without
issue.”</p>

<p>John, Duke of Burgundy, surnamed the Fearless, succeeded to the
dukedom in 1403. He caused the Duke of Orleans to be assassinated in the
streets of Paris, and was himself murdered August 28, 1419, on the
bridge of Montereau, at an interview with the Dauphin, afterwards
Charles VII. John was succeeded by his only son, who bore the title of
Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy.</p>

<p>The Constable, Charles D’Albret, commanded the French army at the
Battle of Agincourt, and was slain on the field.</p>

passed the Somme, Titus Livius asserts, that the King having been
informed of a river which must be crossed, over which was a bridge, and
that his progress depended in a great degree upon securing possession of
it, despatched some part of his forces to defend it from any attack, or
from being destroyed. They found many of the enemy ready to receive
them, to whom they gave battle, and after a severe conflict, they
captured the bridge, and kept&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>It will be seen by the following extract from the anonymous
Chronicler how minutely Shakespeare has adhered to history&mdash; “There
was brought to the King in that plain a certain English robber, who,
contrary to the laws of God and the Royal Proclamation, had stolen from
a church a pix of copper gilt, found in his sleeve, which he happened to
mistake for gold, in which the Lord’s body was kept; and in the next
village where he passed the night, by decree of the King, he was put to
death on the gallows.” Titus Livius relates that Henry commanded his
army to halt until the sacrilege was expiated. He first caused the pix
to be restored to the Church, and the offender was then led, bound as a
thief, through the army, and afterwards hung upon a tree, that every man
might behold him.</p>

Comes down, <span class = "smallroman">R.</span></p>

<p><i>Will.</i> Under what captain serve you?</p>

<p><i>K. Hen.</i> Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> A good old commander, and a most kind gentleman:
I&nbsp;pray you, what thinks he of our estate?</p>

<p><i>K. Hen.</i> Even as men wrecked upon a sand, that look to be
washed off the next tide.</p>

<p><i>Bates.</i> (<span class = "smallroman">L.</span>) He hath not told
his thought to the king?</p>

<p><i>K. Hen.</i> No; nor it is not meet he should.
<span class = "stagedir">Crosses to centre.</span>
For, though I speak it to you, I&nbsp;think the king is but a man, as I
am: the violet smells to him as it doth to me; the element shows to him
as it doth to me; all his senses have but human conditions:<a class =
"tag" name = "tagIV_7" id = "tagIV_7" href = "#noteIV_7">7</a> therefore
when he sees reason of fears, as we do, his fears, out of doubt, be of
the same relish as ours are: Yet, in reason, no man should possess him
with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing it, should dishearten
his army.</p>

<p><i>Bates.</i> He may show what outward courage he will; but I
believe, as cold a night as ’tis, he could wish himself in the Thames up
to the neck; and so I would he were, and I by him, at all adventures, so
we were quit here.</p>

<p><i>K. Hen.</i> (<span class = "smallroman">C.</span>) By my troth, I
will speak my conscience of the king: I&nbsp;think he would not wish
himself any where but where he&nbsp;is.</p>

<p><i>Bates.</i> (<span class = "smallroman">L.</span>) Then ’would he
were here alone; so should he be sure to be ransomed, and a many poor
men’s lives saved.</p>

<p><i>K. Hen.</i> I dare say you love him not so ill, to wish him here
alone, howsoever you speak this, to feel other men’s minds: Methinks I
could not die any where so contented as in the king’s company; his cause
being just, and his quarrel honourable.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_8"
id = "tagIV_8" href = "#noteIV_8">8</a></p>

<p><i>Will.</i> (<span class = "smallroman">R.</span>) That’s more than
we know.</p>

<p><i>Bates.</i> Ay, or more than we should seek after; for we know
enough, if we know we are the king’s subjects: if
<span class = "pagenum">58</span>
his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out
of&nbsp;us.</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> But if the cause be not good, the king himself hath a
heavy rekoning to make, when all those legs and arms and heads, chopped
off in battle, shall join together at the latter day,<a class = "tag"
name = "tagIV_9" id = "tagIV_9" href = "#noteIV_9">9</a> and cry
all&mdash;We died at such place; some swearing; some crying for a
surgeon; some, upon their wives left poor behind them; some, upon the
debts they owe; some, upon their children rawly left.<a class = "tag"
name = "tagIV_10" id = "tagIV_10" href = "#noteIV_10">10</a> I&nbsp;am
afeard there are few die well that die in battle; for how can they
charitably dispose of any thing, when blood is their argument? Now, if
these men do not die well, it will be a black matter for the king that
led them to it; whom to disobey were against all proportion of
subjection.</p>

<p><i>K. Hen.</i> So, if a son, that is by his father sent about
merchandise, do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the imputation of his
wickedness, by your rule, should be imposed upon his father that sent
him:&mdash;But this is not so: the king is not bound to answer the
particular endings of his soldiers, nor the father of his son, for they
purpose not their death, when they purpose their services. Every
subject’s duty is the king’s; but every subject’s soul is his own.
Therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his
bed, wash every mote out of his conscience: and dying so, death is to
him advantage; or not dying, the time was blessedly lost wherein such
preparation was gained.</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> ’Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the ill is upon
his own head; the king is not to answer for&nbsp;it.</p>

<p><i>Bates.</i> I do not desire he should answer for me; and yet I
determine to fight lustily for him.</p>

<p><i>K. Hen.</i> I myself heard the king say he would not be
ransomed.</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> Ay, he said so, to make us fight cheerfully: but, when
our throats are cut, he may be ransomed, and we ne’er the wiser.</p>

<p><i>K. Hen.</i> If I live to see it, I will never trust his word
after.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">59</span>
<p><i>Will.</i> That’s a perilous shot out of an elder gun, that a poor
and private displeasure can do against a monarch! you may as well go
about to turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a peacock’s
feather. You’ll never trust his word after! come, ’tis a foolish
saying.</p>

<p><i>K. Hen.</i> Your reproof is something too round:<a class = "tag"

<p><i>K. Hen.</i> I embrace it.</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> How shall I know thee again?</p>

<p><i>K. Hen.</i> Give me any gage of thine, and I will wear it in my
bonnet: then, if ever thou darest acknowledge it, I&nbsp;will make it my
quarrel.</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> Here’s my glove: give me another of thine.</p>

<p><i>K. Hen.</i> There.</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> This will I also wear in my cap: if ever thou come to me
and say, after to-morrow. <i>This is my glove</i>, by this hand,

about a quarter of a mile from them at Agincourt and Ruisseauville, and
both armies proceeded to light their fires, and to make the usual
arrangements for a bivouack. The night was very rainy, and much
inconvenience is said to have been experienced in each camp from wet and
cold, accompanied, among the English, by hunger and fatigue. It was
passed in a manner strictly consistent with their relative situations.
The French, confident in their numbers, occupied the hours not
appropriated to sleep in calculating upon their success; and in full
security of a complete victory, played at dice with each other for the
disposal of their prisoners, an archer being valued at a blank, and the
more important persons in proportion; whilst the English were engaged in
preparing their weapons, and in the most solemn acts of religion.<span
class = "gap">***</span>The Chronicler in the text states, that from the
great stillness which prevailed throughout the English camp, the enemy
imagined they were panic-struck, and intended to decamp. Monstrelet
relates that the English “were much fatigued and oppressed by cold,
hunger, and other annoyances; that they made their peace with God, by
confessing their sins with tears, and numbers of them taking the
sacrament; for, as it was related by some prisoners, they looked for
certain death on the morrow.”</p>

<p>(<a class = "hist" name = "noteIV_B" id = "noteIV_B" href =
"#tagIV_B">B</a>) <i>Enter Erpingham.</i>] Sir Thomas Erpingham came
over with Bolingbroke from Bretagne, and was one of the commissioners to
receive King Richard’s abdication. In Henry the Fifth’s time Sir Thomas
was warden of Dover Castle, and at the battle of Agincourt, was
commander of the Archers. This venerable knight is described by
Monstrelet to have grown grey with age and honour; and when orders were
given for the English army to march toward the enemy, by Henry crying
aloud, “Advance banners,” Sir Thomas threw his truncheon in the air as a
signal to the whole field, exclaiming, “Now strike;” and loud and
repeated shouts testified the readiness with which they obeyed the
command.</p>

<p>(<a class = "hist" name = "noteIV_C" id = "noteIV_C" href =
"#tagIV_C">C</a>) <i>I Richard’s body have interred new;</i>] Henry was
anxious not only to repair his own misconduct, but also to make amends
for
<span class = "pagenum">76</span>
those iniquities into which policy or the necessity of affairs had
betrayed his father. He expressed the deepest sorrow for the fate of the
unhappy Richard, did justice to the memory of that unfortunate prince,
even performed his funeral obsequies with pomp and solemnity, and
cherished all those who had distinguished themselves by their loyalty
and attachment towards him. &mdash;<i>Hume’s History of England.</i></p>

<p>(<a class = "hist" name = "noteIV_D" id = "noteIV_D" href =
"#tagIV_D">D</a>) <i>Enter Orleans.</i>] Charles Duke of Orleans was
wounded and taken prisoner at Agincourt. Henry refused all ransom for
him, and he remained in captivity twenty-three years.</p>

<p>This prince was a celebrated poet, and some of his most beautiful
verses were composed during his confinement in the Tower of London. He
married Isabella of Valois, daughter of Charles VI. and Isabeau of
Bavaria, eldest sister to the Princess Katharine, Queen of
Henry&nbsp;V.</p>

<p>Isabella was the widow of our Richard the Second when she married the
Duke of Orleans.</p>

<p>After the victory of Agincourt, the following anecdote is related by
Remy:&mdash; “During their journey to Calais, at a place where they
rested, Henry caused bread and wine to be brought to him, which he sent
to the Duke of Orleans; but the French Prince would neither eat nor
drink. This being reported to the King, he imagined that it arose from
dissatisfaction, and, therefore, went to the duke. ‘Noble cousin,’ said
Henry, ‘how are you?’ ‘Well, my lord,’ answered the duke. ‘Why, then, is
it,’ added the King, ‘that you will neither eat nor drink?’ To which
Orleans replied, ‘that truly he had no inclination for food.’ ‘Noble
cousin,’ rejoined Henry, ‘be of good heart. I&nbsp;know that God gave me
the victory over the French, not that I deserved it, but I fully believe
that he wished to punish them; and if what I have heard is true, it is
not to be wondered at, for never were there greater disorder,
sensuality, sins, and vices seen than now prevail in France; which it is
horrible to hear described; and if God is provoked, it is not a subject
of surprise, and no one can be astonished.’ Many more conversations are
said to have passed between the King and the Duke of Orleans, and the
commisseration and courtesy of the former to his prisoners is mentioned
by every writer in terms of just praise.”</p>

<p>(<a class = "hist" name = "noteIV_E" id = "noteIV_E" href =
"#tagIV_E">E</a>) <i>The English army, drawn up for battle;</i>] The
victory gained at Agincourt, in the year 1415, is, in a great measure,
ascribed to the English Archers, and that there might be no want of
arrows, Henry V. ordered the sheriffs of several counties to procure
feathers from the wings of geese, plucking six from each goose. An
archer of this time was clad in a cuirass, or a hauberk of chain-mail,
with a salade on his head, which was a kind of bacinet. Every man had a
good bow, a&nbsp;sheaf of arrows, and a sword. Fabian describes the
archer’s dress at the battle of Agincourt. “The yeomen had their limbs
at liberty, for their hose was fastened with one point, and their
jackets were easy to shoot
<span class = "pagenum">77</span>
in, so that they might draw bows of great strength, and shoot arrows a
yard long.” Some are described as without hats or caps, others with caps
of boiled leather, or wicker work, crossed over with iron; some without
shoes, and all in a very dilapidated condition. Each bore on his
shoulder a long stake, sharpened at both extremities, which he was
instructed to fix obliquely before him in the ground, and thus oppose a
rampart of pikes to the charge of the French Cavalry.</p>

<p>O that we now had here</p>
<p>But one ten thousand of those men in England</p>
<p>That do no work to day!]</p>
</div>

<p>A certain lord Walter Hungerford, knight, was regretting in the
king’s presence that he had not, in addition to the small retinue which
he had there, ten thousand of the best English Archers, who would be
desirous of being with him; when the King said, Thou speaketh foolishly,
for, by the God of Heaven, on whose grace I have relied, and in whom I
have a firm hope of victory, I&nbsp;would not, even if I could, increase
my number by one; for those whom I have are the people of God, whom He
thinks me worthy to have at this time. Dost thou not believe the
Almighty, with these his humble few, is able to conquer the haughty
opposition of the French, who pride themselves on their numbers, and
their own strength, as if it might be said they would do as they liked?
And in my opinion, God, of his true justice, would not bring any
disaster upon one of so great confidence, as neither fell out to Judas
Maccabeus until he became distrustful, and thence deservedly fell into
ruin. &mdash;<i>Nicolas’s History of Agincourt.</i></p>

<p>(<a class = "hist" name = "noteIV_G" id = "noteIV_G" href =
"#tagIV_G">G</a>) <i>Enter King Henry, attended.</i>] Henry rose with
the earliest dawn, and immediately heard three masses. He was habited in
his “<i>cote d’armes</i>,” containing the arms of France and England
quarterly, and wore on his bacinet a very rich crown of gold and jewels,
circled like an imperial crown, that is, arched over. The earliest
instance of an arched crown worn by an English monarch. &mdash;<i>Vide
Planché’s History of British Costume.</i></p>

<p>King Henry had at Agincourt for his person five banners; that is, the
banner of the Trinity, the banner of St. George, the banner of St.
Edward, the banner of St. Edmund, and the banner of his own arms. “When
the King of England had drawn up his order of battle he made a fine
address to his troops, exhorting them to act well; saying, that he was
come into France to recover his lawful inheritance, and that he had good
and just cause to claim it; that in that quarrel they might freely and
surely fight; that they should remember that they were born in the
kingdom where their fathers and mothers, wives and children, now dwelt,
and therefore they ought to strive to return there with great glory and
fame; that the kings of England, his predecessors, had gained many noble
battles and successes over the French; that on that day every one should
endeavour to preserve his own person and the honor of the crown of the
King of England. He moreover
<span class = "pagenum">78</span>
reminded them that the French boasted they would cut off three fingers
from the right hand of every archer they should take, so that their shot
should never again kill man nor horse. The army cried out loudly,
saying, ‘Sir, we pray God give you a good life, and the victory over
your enemies.’” &mdash;<i>Nicolas’s History of Agincourt.</i></p>

<p>The banner of the Oriflamme is said to have been unfurled by the
French for the last time at Agincourt.</p>

<p>(<a class = "hist" name = "noteIV_H" id = "noteIV_H" href =
"#tagIV_H">H</a>) <i>The feast of Crispian.</i>] The battle of Agincourt
was fought upon the 25th of October, 1415, St. Crispin’s day. The legend
upon which this is founded, is as follows:&mdash; “Crispinus and
Crispianus were brethren, born at Rome; from whence they travelled to
Soissons in France, about the year 303, to propagate the Christian
religion; but because they would not be chargeable to others for their
maintenance, they exercised the trade of shoemakers; but the Governor of
the town, discovering them to be Christians, ordered them to be beheaded
about the year 303. From which time, the shoemakers made choice of them
for their tutelar saints.” &mdash;<i>See Hall’s Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>(<a class = "hist" name = "noteIV_I" id = "noteIV_I" href =
"#tagIV_I">I</a>) <i>Bedford and Exeter, Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury
and Gloster.</i>] Although Shakespeare has adhered very closely to
history in many parts of Henry V., he has deviated very much from it in
the <i>Dramatis Personæ</i>. He makes the Duke of Bedford accompany
Henry to Harfleur and Agincourt when he was Regent of England. The Earl
of Exeter, or, more properly speaking, the Earl of Dorset, was left to
command Harfleur; the Earl of Westmoreland, so far from quitting
England, was appointed to defend the marches of Scotland, nor does it
appear that the Earl of Salisbury was either at Harfleur or Agincourt.
The Earl of Warwick<a class = "tag" name = "tag5a" id = "tag5a" href =
"#note5a">*</a> had returned to England ill from Harfleur. The
characters introduced in the play who really were at Agincourt, are the
Dukes of Gloucester and York, and Sir Thomas Erpingham.</p>

<p>Holinshed states that the English army consisted of 15,000, and the
French of 60,000 horse and 40,000 infantry&mdash;in all, 100,000.
Walsingham and Harding represent the English as but 9,000, and other
authors say that the number of French amounted to 150,000. Fabian says
the French were 40,000, and the English only 7,000. The battle lasted
only three hours.</p>

"#tagIV_K">K</a>) <i>How thou pleasest, Heaven, dispose the day.</i>] At
the battle of Agincourt, having chosen a convenient spot on which to
martial his men, the king sent privately two hundred archers into a low
meadow, which was on one of his flanks, where they were so well secured
by a deep ditch and a marsh, that the enemy could not come near them.
Then he divided his infantry into three squadrons, or battles; the
van-warde, or avant-guard, composed entirely of archers; the
middle-warde, of bill-men only; and the rerewarde,
<span class = "pagenum">79</span>
of bill-men and archers mixed together; the horse-men, as wings, went on
the flanks of each of the battles. He also caused stakes to be made of
wood about five or six feet long, headed with sharp iron; these were
fixed in the ground, and the archers so placed before them that they
were entirely hid from the sight of the enemy. When, therefore, the
heavy cavalry of the French charged, which was done with the utmost
impetuosity, under the idea of cutting down and riding over the archers,
they shrunk at once behind the stakes, and the Frenchmen, unable to stop
their horses, rode full upon them, so that they overthrew their riders,
and caused the utmost confusion. The infantry, who were to follow up and
support this charge, were so struck with amazement that they hesitated,
and by this were lost, for during the panic the English archers threw
back their bows, and with axes, bills, glaives, and swords, slew the
French, till they met the middle-warde. The king himself, according to
Speed, rode in the main battle completely armed, his shield quartering
the achievements of France and England; upon his helm he wore a coronet
encircled with pearls and precious stones, and after the victory,
although it had been cut and bruised, he would not suffer it to be
ostentatiously exhibited to the people, but ordered all his men to give
the glory to God alone. His horse was one of fierce courage, and had a
bridle and furniture of goldsmiths’ work, and the caparisons were most
richly embroidered with the victorious ensigns of the English monarchy.
Thus is he represented on his great seal, with the substitution of a
knights’ cap, and the crest, for the chaplet. Elmham’s account, from
which this is amplified, is more particular in some of the details; he
relates, that the king appeared on a palfrey, followed by a train of led
horses, ornamented with the most gorgeous trappings; his helmet was of
polished steel, surmounted with a coronet sparkling with jewels, and on
his surcoat, or rather jupon, were emblazoned the arms of France and
England, azure, three fleurs-de-lis or, and gules, three lion’s passant
guardant or. The nobles, in like manner, were decorated with their
proper armorial bearings. Before him was borne the royal standard, which
was ornamented with gold and splendid colours. An account of the
memorable battle of Azincourt, or Agincourt, fought on the 25th of
October, 1415, is thus related by Mr. Turner:&mdash; “At dawn the King
of England had matins and the mass chaunted in his army. He stationed
all the horses and baggage in the village, under such small guard as he
could spare, having resolved to fight the battle on foot. He sagaciously
perceived that his only chance of victory rested in the superiority of
the personal fortitude and activity of his countrymen, and to bring them
face to face, and arm to arm, with their opponents, was the simple
object of his tactical dispositions. He formed his troops into three
divisions, with two wings. The centre, in which he stationed himself, he
planted to act against the main body of the French, and he placed the
right and left divisions, with their wings, at a small distance only
from himself. He so chose his ground that the village protected his
rear, and hedges and briars
<span class = "pagenum">80</span>
defended his flanks. Determined to shun no danger, but to be a
conspicuous example to his troops on a day when no individual exertions
could be spared, he put on a neat and shining armour, with a large and
brilliant helmet, and on this he placed a crown, radiant with its
jewels, and he put over him a tunic adorned with the arms of France and
England. He mounted his horse, and proceeded to address his troops. The
French were commanded by the Constable of France, and with him were the
Dukes of Orleans, Burgundy, Berry, and Alençon, the Marshal and Admiral
of France, and a great assemblage of French nobility. Their force was
divided into three great battalions, and continued formed till ten
o’clock, not advancing to the attack. They were so numerous as to be
able to draw up thirty deep, the English but four. A&nbsp;thousand
speared horsemen skirmished from each of the horns of the enemy’s line,
and it appeared crowded with balistae for the projection of stones of
all sizes on Henry’s little army. Henry sent a part of his force behind
the village of Agincourt, where the French had placed no men at arms. He
moved from the rear of his army, unperceived, two hundred archers, to
hide themselves in a meadow on the flank of the French advanced line. An
old and experienced knight, Sir Thomas Erpingham, formed the rest into
battle array for an attack, putting the archers in front, and the men at
arms behind. The archers had each a sharp stake pointed at both ends, to
use against the French horse. Sir Thomas having completed his formation,
threw up his truncheon in the air, and dismounted. The English began the
attack, which the French had awaited, not choosing to give the advantage
as at Poictiers; but when they saw them advance, they put themselves in
motion, and their cavalry charged; these were destroyed by the English
archers. The French, frightened by the effect of the arrows, bent their
heads to prevent them from entering the vizors of their helmets, and,
pressing forward, became so wedged together as to be unable to strike.
The archers threw back their bows, and, grasping their swords,
battle-axes, and other weapons, cut their way to the second line. At
this period the ambushed archers rushed out, and poured their impetuous
and irresistable arrows into the centre of the assailed force, which
fell in like manner with the first line. In short, every part
successively gave way, and the English had only to kill and take
prisoners.”</p>

III. Richard, Earl of Cambridge, who appears in the second act of this

He (the king) asked Montjoye to whom the victory belonged, to him or to
the King of France? Montjoye replied that the victory was his, and could
not be claimed by the King of France. The king said to the French and
English heralds, “It is not we who have made this great slaughter, but
the omnipotent God, as we believe, for a punishment of the sins of the
French. The king then asked the name of the castle he saw near him. He
was told it was Agincourt. Well, then, said he, since all battles should
bear the name of the fortress nearest to the spot where they were
fought, this battle shall from henceforth bear the ever durable name of
Agincourt.” &mdash;<i>Nicolas’s History of Agincourt.</i></p>

During the battle, the Duke of Alençon most valiantly broke through the
English line, and advanced, fighting, near to the king, insomuch that he
wounded and struck down the Duke of York. King Henry, seeing this,
stepped forth to his aid, and as he was leaning down to raise him, the
Duke of Alençon gave him a blow on the helmet that struck off part of
his crown. The king’s guard on this surrounded him, when, seeing he
could no way escape death but by surrendering, he lifted up his arm, and
said to the king, “<i>I am the Duke of Alençon, and yield myself to
you;</i>” but as the king was holding out his hand to receive his
pledge, he was put to death by the guards. &mdash;<i>Nicolas’s History

There is not much difficulty in forming a correct estimate of the
numbers of the French slain at Agincourt, for if those writers who only
state that from three to five thousand were killed, merely meant the
men-at-arms and persons of superior rank, and which is exceedingly
probable, we may at once adopt the calculation of Monstrelet, Elmham,
&amp;c., and estimate the whole loss on the field at from ten to eleven
thousand men. It is worthy of remark how very nearly the different
statements on the subject approach to each other, and which can only be
explained by the fact that the dead had been carefully numbered.</p>

<p>Among the most illustrious persons slain were the Dukes of Brabant,
Barré, and Alençon, five counts, and a still greater proportion of
distinguished knights; and the Duke of Orleans, the Count of Vendôsme,
who was taken by Sir John Cornwall,
<span class = "pagenum">82</span>
the Marshall Bouciqualt, and numerous other individuals of distinction,
whose names are minutely recorded by Monstrelet, were made prisoners.
The loss of the English army has been variously estimated. The
discrepancies respecting the number slain on the part of the victors,
form a striking contrast to the accuracy of the account of the loss of
their enemies. The English writers vary in their statements from
seventeen to one hundred, whilst the French chroniclers assert that from
three hundred to sixteen hundred individuals fell on that occasion. St.
Remy and Monstrelet assert that sixteen hundred were slain.

when the king saw no appearance of enemies, he caused the retreat to be
blown, and gathering his army together, gave thanks to Almighty God for
so happy a victory, causing his prelates and chaplains to sing this
psalm&mdash;<i>In exitu Israel de Egypto</i>; and commanding every man
to kneel down on the ground at this verse&mdash;<i>Non nobis domine, non
nobis, <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘seel’">sed</ins>

certain anthems to be sung, giving laud and praise to God, and not
boasting of his own force, or any human power.</p>

innumerable boys, representing angels, arrayed in white, and with
countenances shining with gold, and glittering wings, and virgin locks
set with precious sprigs of laurel, who, at the King’s approach, sang
with melodious voices, and with organs, an English anthem.</p>

<p class = "gap">******</p>

<p>“A company of Prophets, of venerable hoariness, dressed in golden
coats and mantles, with their heads covered and wrapped
<span class = "pagenum">85</span>

a&nbsp;psalm of thanksgiving.</p>

one accord at the King’s approach in a sweet tune.</p>

beneath minæ of gold, with bows of laurel; round about angels shone with
celestial gracefulness, chaunting sweetly, and with all sorts of

VI., King of France, and his Queen, Isabella of Bavaria. She was born in
Paris, October 27th, 1401. Monstrelet relates, that on Trinity Sunday,
June 3rd, the King of England wedded the lady Katharine in the church at
Troyes, and that great pomp and magnificence were displayed by him and
his princess, as if he had been king of the whole world. Katharine was
crowned Queen of England February 24, 1421; and shortly after the death
of her heroic husband, which event took place August 31st, 1422, the
queen married a Welch gentleman of the name of Owen Tudor, by whom she
had three sons and one daughter. The eldest son, Edmund, married
Margaret Beaufort, the heiress of the house of Somerset. His
half-brother, Henry VI., created him Earl of Richmond. He died before he
reached twenty years of age, leaving an infant son, afterwards Henry
VII., the first king of the Tudor line. Katharine died January 3rd,
1437, in the thirty-sixth year of her age, and was buried at Westminster
Abbey.</p>

oaths well kept and prosp’rous be;</i>] The principal articles of the
treaty were, that Henry should espouse the Princess Catherine: That King
Charles, during his life time, should enjoy the title and dignity of
King of France: That Henry should be declared and acknowledged heir of
the monarchy, and be entrusted with the present administration of the
government: That that kingdom should pass to his heirs general: That
France and England should for ever be united under one king; but should
still retain their several usages, customs, and privileges: That all the
princes, peers, vassals, and communities of France, should swear, that
they would both adhere to the future succession of
<span class = "pagenum">96</span>
Henry, and pay him present obedience as regent: That this prince should
unite his arms to those of King Charles and the Duke of Burgundy, in
order to subdue the adherents of Charles, the pretended dauphin; and
that these three princes should make no peace or truce with him but by
common consent and agreement. Such was the tenour of this famous treaty;
a&nbsp;treaty which, as nothing but the most violent animosity could
dictate it, so nothing but the power of the sword could carry it into
execution. It is hard to say whether its consequences, had it taken
effect, would have proved more pernicious to England or France. It must
have reduced the former kingdom to the rank of a province: It would have
entirely disjointed the succession of the latter, and have brought on
the destruction of the royal family; as the houses of Orleans, Anjou,
Alençon, Britanny, Bourbon, and of Burgundy itself, whose titles were
preferable to that of the English princes, would, on that account, have
been exposed to perpetual jealousy and persecution from the sovereign.
There was even a palpable deficiency in Henry’s claim, which no art
could palliate. For, besides the insuperable objections to which Edward
the Third’s pretensions were exposed, <i>he</i> was not heir to that
monarch: If female succession were admitted, the right had devolved on
the house of Mortimer: Allowing that Richard the Second was a tyrant,
and that Henry the Fourth’s merits in deposing him were so great towards
the English, as to justify that nation in placing him on the throne,
Richard had nowise offended France, and his rival had merited nothing of
that kingdom: It could not possibly be pretended that the crown of
France was become an appendage to that of England; and that a prince who
by any means got possession of the latter, was, without farther
question, entitled to the former. So that, on the whole, it must be
allowed that Henry’s claim to France was, if possible, still more
unintelligible than the title by which his father had mounted the throne
of England. &mdash;<i>Hume’s History of England.</i></p>

The throne is powdered with the letter S. This decoration made its
appearance in the reign of Henry IV., and has been differently accounted
for. The late Sir Samuel Meyrick supposes it to be the initial letter of
Henry’s motto, “Souveraine.” The King’s costume is copied from Strutt’s
“Regal Antiquities.” The dresses of the English throughout the play are
taken from the works of Strutt, Meyrick, Shaw, and Hamilton Smith. The

Extracts from the Account of the Siege of Harfleur, selected from the
pages of the anonymous Chronicler who was an eyewitness of the
event.</p>

<p>“Our King, who sought peace, not war, in order that he might further
arm the cause in which he was engaged with the shield of justice offered
peace to the besieged, if they would open the gates to him, and restore,
as was their duty, freely, without compulsion, that town, the noble
hereditary portion of his Crown of England, and of his Dukedom of
Normandy.</p>

<p>“But as they, despising and setting at nought this offer, strove to
keep possession of, and to defend the town against him, our King
summoned to fight, as it were, against his will, called upon God to
witness his just cause<span class = "gap">***</span>he (King Henry) gave
himself no rest by day or night, until having fitted and fixed his
engines and guns under the walls, he had planted them within shot of the
enemy, against the front of the town, and against the walls, gates, and
towers, of the same<span class = "gap">***</span>so that taking aim at
the place to be battered, the guns from beneath blew forth stones by the
force of ignited powers,<span class = "gap">***</span>and in the mean
time our King, with his guns and engines, so battered the said bulwark,
and the walls and towers on every side, that within a few days, by the
impetuosity and fury of the stones, the same bulwark was in a great part
broken down; and the walls and towers from which the enemy had sent
forth their weapons, the bastions falling in ruins, were
<span class = "pagenum">42</span>
rendered defenceless; and very fine edifices, even in the middle of the
city, either lay altogether in ruins, or threatened an inevitable fall;
or at least were so shaken as to be exceedingly damaged.<span class =
"gap">****</span>And although our guns had disarmed the bulwark, walls,
and towers during the day, the besieged by night, with logs, faggots,
and tubs on vessels full of earth, mud, and sand or stones, piled up
within the shattered walls, and with other barricadoes, refortified the
streets.<span class = "gap">**</span>The King had caused towers and
wooden bulwarks to the height of the walls, and ladders and other
instruments, besides those which he had brought with him for the
assault.” &mdash;We are then told that the enemy contrived to set these
engines on fire ’by means of powders, and combustibles prepared on the
walls.’</p>

<p>The History then states that “a fire broke out where the strength of
the French was greater, and the French themselves were overcome with
resisting, and in endeavouring to extinguish the fire, until at length
by force of arms, darts, and flames, their strength was destroyed.
Leaving the place therefore to our party, they fled and retreated
beneath the walls for protection; most carefully blocking up the
entrance with timber, stones, earth, and mud, lest our people should
rush in upon them through the same passage.”</p>

<p>“On the following day a conference was held with the Lord de Gaucort,
who acted as Captain, and with the more powerful leaders, whether it was
the determination of the inhabitants to surrender the town without
suffering further rigour of death or war.<span class =
"gap">****</span>On that night they entered into a treaty with the King,
that if the French King, or the Dauphin, his first-born, being informed,
should not raise the <ins class = "correction" title = "spelling unchanged">seige</ins>, and deliver them by force of arms within the
first hour after morn on the Sunday following, they would surrender to
him the town, and themselves, and their property.”</p>

<p>“And neither at the aforesaid hour on the following Sunday, nor
within the time, the French King, the Dauphin, nor any one else, coming
forward to raise the siege.<span class = "gap">****</span>The aforesaid
Lord de Gaucort came from the town into the king’s presence, accompanied
by those persons who before had sworn to keep the articles, and
surrendering to him the keys of the Corporation, submitted themselves,
together with the citizens, to his grace.<span class =
"gap">****</span>Then the banners of St. George and the King were fixed
upon the gates of the town, and the King advanced his illustrious uncle,
the Lord Thomas Beaufort, Earl of Dorset (afterwards Duke of Exeter) to
be keeper and captain of the town, having delivered to him the
keys.”</p>

<p>Thus, after a vigorous siege of about thirty-six days, one of the
most important towns of Normandy fell into the hands of the invaders.
The Chronicler in the text informs us, that the dysentery had carried
off infinitely more of the English army than were slain in the siege;
that about five thousand men were then so dreadfully debilitated by that
disease, that they were unable to proceed, and were therefore sent to
England; that three hundred
<span class = "pagenum">43</span>
men-at-arms and nine hundred archers were left to garrison Harfleur;
that great numbers had cowardly deserted the King, and returned home by
stealth; and that after all these deductions, not more than nine hundred
lances and five thousand archers remained fit for service.</p>

<p>Hume, in his History of England, relates that “King Henry landed near
Harfleur, at the head of an army of 6,000 men-at-arms, and 24,000 foot,
mostly archers. He immediately began the siege of that place, which was
valiantly defended by d’Estoüleville, and under him by de Guitri, de
Gaucourt, and others of the French nobility; but as the garrison was
weak, and the fortifications in bad repair, the governor was at last
obliged to capitulate, and he promised to surrender the place if he
received no succour before the 18th of September. The day came, and
there was no appearance of a French army to relieve him. Henry, taking
possession of the town, placed a garrison in it, and expelled all the
French inhabitants, with an intention of peopling it anew with English.
The fatigues of this siege, and the unusual heat of the season, had so
wasted the English army, that Henry could enter on no farther
enterprise, and was obliged to think of returning to England. He had
dismissed his transports, which could not anchor in an open road upon
the enemy’s coasts, and he lay under a necessity of marching by land to
Calais before he could reach a place of safety. A&nbsp;numerous French
army of 14,000 men at-arms, and 40,000 foot, was by this time assembled
in Normandy, under the constable d’Albret, a&nbsp;force which, if
prudently conducted, was sufficient either to trample down the English
in the open field, or to harass and reduce to nothing their small army
before they could finish so long and difficult a march. Henry,
therefore, cautiously offered to sacrifice his conquest of Harfleur for
a safe passage to Calais; but his proposal being rejected, he determined
to make his way by valour and conduct through all the opposition of the
enemy.”</p>
